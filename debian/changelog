  * fix issue in destruction order
  * fix memory leak
  * fix thread safety issues
  * Improve error message
  * Leave a note for posterity
  * Fix windows builds
  * Do not fail fast. We want results of both sanitizer runs
  * Combine sanitizer actions into a single file
  * use gtest_discover_tests to regiester the unit tests
    this modern approach registers many individual tests instead of a single monolitic test
    so if one fails the rest continue running which allows the developer to flag multiple
    failing tests on a single run
    It also speeds up testing since tests run in parallel
  * Add support for sanitizers including some GHAs
  * Remove unused conan.cmake (#1016 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/1016>)
  * Improve handling of dependencies (#1012 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/1012>)
  * update tinyxml to version 11.0
  * fix potential compilation errors
  * compile for c++ 17 (#1013 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/1013>)

  * remove cpp-sqlite
  * update cppzmq to 4.11.0
  * remove wildcards from 3rd party
  * Clean up VerifyXML logic (#1000 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/1000>)
    * Refactor VerifyXML to clarify logic
    - Reduces duplication in VerifyXML by handling the ID check for built-in
    node types up front so they can then be definitively looked up in the
    registered nodes.
    - Enhances error messaging in VerifyXML by using *either* the node name
    *or* the ID, depending on which is appropriate, instead of leaving
    users guessing "which Decorator is wrong"
    - Fixes custom Action and Condition nodes using shorthand syntax not
    being properly verified
    - Fixes <Control ID="ReactiveSequence"/> not being verified with the
    same logic as <ReactiveSequence/>
    - Fixes <Action ID="MyAction"/> not triggering a behavior lookup when
    <MyAction/> would.
    * fix tests that were failing due to bad assumptions
  * Append SQLite3_INCLUDE_DIRS to BTCPP_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIRS, otherwise sqlite3.h won't be found (#1002 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/1002>)
